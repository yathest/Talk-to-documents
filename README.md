# Talk-to-your-Documents

The Python scripts in this repo use Atlas Vector Search with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to build a Question Answering application based on Documents Uploaded. I used the LangChain framework, Gemini API , as well as Gradio in conjunction with Atlas Vector Search in a RAG architecture, to create this app.

Note: In this demo, I've used:

DB Name: langchain_demo
Collection Name: collection_of_text_blobs
The text files that I am using as my source data are saved in a directory named sample_files.
